# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The goal is to identify potential churn risks and provide insights to improve customer retention strategies.

## Project HighlightsðŸš€
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset. 
- Built predictive models using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Classifier.
- Developed a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization of key findings.

## Contains
- Library Imports

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing
- Conducted data cleaning and transformation to enhance data quality.
- Handled missing values - TotalCharges are replaced with NaN and rows with missing values are dropped.
- Feature Engineering - Converting categorical features to numerical features using **Label encoding** , Target variable Churn is extracted.

## Exploratory Data Ananlysis (EDA)
- Questions to address:

What is the proportion of customers who have churned versus those who have not churned?

How does the monthly charges vary between customers who have churned and those who have not?

How does the proportion of churn vary across different contract types (month-to-month, one year, two-year)?

How does the presence or absence of internet service affect customer churn rates?

5. How does the type of internet service (DSL, Fiber Optic, None) influence monthly charges and customer churn?

## Statistical Tests 
- feature selection techniques such as ANOVA test( F1-score) and chi-square test which improved model performance.
- Chi Square Test (categorical_features)
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1526a5d-6210-4fee-b58a-c04ca3ef7a8d)
- Contract has the highest score because it strongly influences customer churn. Short-term contracts offer flexibility, leading to higher churn,while long-term contracts create retention, - making it a key predictor of customer behavior.

- Anova Testing (Numerical features) or F-score
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b550f0cc-084f-436a-82c1-8ea4432ef853)
- "Tenure" has the highest ANOVA score, indicating its strong influence on predicting customer churn.

## Feature importance using Random Forest
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f017d25-d6ec-477f-8ca8-b95fe33c50ed)
- As shown in above graph total charges , monthly charges ,tenure and contract are significant features by using Random Forest feature_importance

## Normalization (Standardization)
- Feature scaling for numerical_features - ['tenure', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges']

## Model Development
- Built a customer churn prediction model using various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Model Comparison
| Accuracy Score | Model Name    |
|----------------|---------------|
| 0.80           | SVM           |
| 0.79           | LR            |
| 0.77           | KNN           |
| 0.77           | XGB           |
| 0.77           | RANDOM_F      |


## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **80%** with the Logistic Regression model, with additional performance metrics indicating:
  - Precision: 0.62
  - Recall: 0.43
  - F1-Score: 0.50

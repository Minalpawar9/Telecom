## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The goal is to identify potential churn risks and provide insights to improve customer retention strategies.

# Project HighlightsðŸš€
-Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset. 
-Built predictive models using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Classifier.
-Developed a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization of key findings.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Flask
- Power BI

## Data Preprocessing
- Conducted data cleaning and transformation to enhance data quality.
- Handled missing values and performed feature engineering.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized data distributions and relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Analyzed feature importance using Random Forest.
- ![What is the proportion of customers who have churned versus those who have not churned?](C:\Users\appsl\Downloads\e.png)


## Model Development
- Built a customer churn prediction model using various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **80%** with the Logistic Regression model, with additional performance metrics indicating:
  - Precision: 0.83
  - Recall: 0.56
  - F1-Score: 0.50
